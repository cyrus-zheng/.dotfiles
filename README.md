# My Dotfiles
These are my dotfile configuration files for different software in Bash. These files help manage the functionality of the scripts and commands that are being run.
## .vimrc
This is my custom configuration for Vim. This file will turn on syntax, sets number, sets autoindent, sets ruler, changes the color to elflord, and set the FileType.
## .bashrc
This is my custom .bashsrc configuration for Bash. This file sets a few aliases to be used as shortcuts. It also sets functions and variables. This file is filled with helpful tools.
